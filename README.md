I'm new to Bangalore, but I'm already falling in love with this city. This wiki is my journey of discovery 

Consider this an open invitation. Whether you're another newcomer trying to make sense of Bangalore, a longtime resident with insider tips, or just curious about what makes this city tick - you're welcome here. Every spot is a story, every location a potential adventure.
